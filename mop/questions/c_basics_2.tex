Examine the following program:

\begin{verbatim}
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    int number = atoi(argv[1]);      // atoi parses int from str
    int found;
    do {
        int i;
        found = 1;
        --number;
        for (i = 2; i < number; ++i) {
            if (!(number % i)) {
                found = 0;
                break;
            }
        }
    } while (!found);
    printf("%d", number);
    return 0;
}
\end{verbatim}

\begin{enumerate}

\item What does this program do? What is the output of \texttt{./a.out 10}? Step through the program execution if it helps.

\begin{answer}
This program finds the largest prime number less than the first command line argument.

\texttt{./a.out 10} sets \texttt{number} = 10.

For each iteration of the do-while loop, \texttt{number} is decremented,
then the for-loop tests all integers between 2 and \texttt{number-1} inclusive for something that divides evenly into \texttt{number}.
If such a value exists, it sets \texttt{found} = 0 and breaks out of the for-loop, but continues through the outer do-while loop.
Otherwise \texttt{found} is still set to 1, which means \texttt{!found} is 0, so it breaks out of the do-while loop, prints the answer, and returns.

For input 10, the answer 7 is printed.
\end{answer}



\item Why can we write \texttt{if (!(number \% i))} instead of \texttt{if (number \% i == 0)}? (These statements are equivalent.)

\begin{answer}
If statements in C check whether their condition is not equal to 0, rather than if they are equal to a dedicated "true" value. If \texttt{number \% i} is 0 (that is, \texttt{number} is a multiple of \texttt{i}), then \texttt{!(number \% i)} will equal 1, which is not equal to 0, so the if condition will be satisfied. Comparison operators all produce 0 or 1, so here, \texttt{number \% i == 0} would evaluate to \texttt{0 == 0}, which evaluates to 1.
\end{answer}

\newpage
\item Rewrite the code using while loops in place of the do-while loop and the for loop.

\begin{answer}
\begin{verbatim}
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    int number = atoi(argv[1]);      // atoi parses int from str
    int found = 0;
    while (!found) {
        int i; 
        found = 1;
        --number;
        i = 1; // Start one below the desired initial value, as i will be immediately incremented.
        while (i < number) {
            ++i;
            if (!(number % i)) {
                found = 0;
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    printf("%d", number);
    return 0;
}
\end{verbatim}

Note that we place the increment statement at the top of the loop body because if the loop body contained a \texttt{continue} statement, the increment statement will always be executed, unlike if the increment statement were placed at the bottom. Because this code does not include a \texttt{continue} statement, initializing \texttt{i} to 2 and placing the increment statement at the bottom of the loop body will also produce the correct behavior.
\end{answer}

\end{enumerate}
