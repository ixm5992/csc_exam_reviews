Abstract Data Types
\begin{enumerate}
\item Generally speaking, ADTs are easier to define and work with in procedural languages like C, as opposed to object-oriented languages like Java or C\#. (\textbf{True} or \textbf{False}). Explain your answer.

\begin{answer} 
\textbf{False}. C lacks object-oriented features that streamline the creation and use of ADTs in the language. C doesn't have access modifiers (e.g., \texttt{private} or \texttt{protected}), so hiding the underlying implementations is tougher, and will often involve the use of pointers.
\end{answer}

\item What is a \emph{primitive data type}? Provide 3 examples of primitive data types in C.

\begin{answer}
Primitive data types are supported by the language itself, as opposed to ones that are built from a combination of other objects (\emph{structured}), and ones that are extensions to the language (\emph{user-defined}). Examples include: \texttt{int}, \texttt{float}, \texttt{char}, \texttt{double}, \texttt{void}.
