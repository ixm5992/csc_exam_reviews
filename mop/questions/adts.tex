Generally speaking, ADTs are easier to define and work with in procedural languages like C, as opposed to object-oriented languages like Java or C\#. (\textbf{True} or \textbf{False}). Explain your answer.

\begin{answer} 
\textbf{False}. C lacks object-oriented features that streamline the creation and use of ADTs in the language. C doesn't have access modifiers (e.g., \texttt{private} or \texttt{protected}), so hiding the underlying implementations is tougher, and will often involve the use of pointers.
