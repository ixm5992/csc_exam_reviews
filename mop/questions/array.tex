\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the issue with the code below? What is the result of the issue?

\begin{lstlisting}
int i, x;
int arr[10];
for (i=0; i < 10; ++i)
{
	scanf("%d", &x); // Reads a number from stdin and stores it in x
	arr[i] = x;
}

for (i=10; i >= 0; --i)
{
	printf("%d\n", arr[i]);
}
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{answer}
The second for loop starts at 10, not 9.
\texttt{arr[10]} is out of bounds, but since C doesn't check for this the behavior is undefined.
It might not actually crash at run time, it might just get whatever happens to be in memory at that location.
\emph{Scary}.
\end{answer}

\item What is the intended behavior of the program?

\begin{answer}
It reads in 10 numbers from stdin and prints them in reverse order.
\end{answer}
