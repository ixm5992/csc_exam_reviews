You create a file named \texttt{sliding.txt} with the following contents (there are newlines between each line, but not at the end of the file):

\begin{verbatim}
>>>>v
>>>>v
>>>>v
>>>>v
>>>>v
\end{verbatim}

However, your no-good friend sneakily changes one of the lines to \begin{verbatim}^<<<<\end{verbatim}
and you don't know which line it is.
Write a program that fixes the file, but only writes 5 characters (it can read the whole file, however).
Do not worry about error handling.
(\textit{Hint:} You can use the \texttt{strstr} function in \texttt{<string.h>},
which takes two strings, searches for the second string inside the first, and returns the \texttt{char*} location within the first string where the second string was found.
You may also need pointer arithmetic.)
