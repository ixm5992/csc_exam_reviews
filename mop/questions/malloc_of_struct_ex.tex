\begin{enumerate}
\item Given the following:
\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=none]
struct Point {
	char label;
	double x;
	double y;
};
\end{lstlisting}

What (specifically) happens when the following command is executed?

\hspace{15mm} \texttt{struct Point *newPoint = malloc( sizeof(struct Point) );}

\begin{answer}
The \texttt{malloc} command allocates space in memory for the entire \texttt{Point struct}.
Given the known sizes of \texttt{char} and \texttt{double} (x and y respectively), exactly x+2y bits are set aside in memory.
Then the memory address of the newly-allocated space is returned and assigned to the \texttt{struct Point*}.
\end{answer}

\item Let's add some more information:
\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=none]
typedef struct Triangle {
	struct Point p1;
	struct Point p2;
	struct Point p3;
} Triangle;
\end{lstlisting}

What (specifically) happens when the following command is executed?

\hspace{15mm} \texttt{Triangle *tri = malloc( sizeof(Triangle) );}

\begin{answer}
The same thing happens, but now we need to know the size of \texttt{Triangle} from the last question.
Based on the definitions provided, this means allocating exactly enough space for three \texttt{Point struct}s.
Because the size of a \texttt{Point struct} is \texttt{X} bits, that means exactly \texttt{3X} bits will be allocated in memory.
Then the memory address is returned as before.
\end{answer}
