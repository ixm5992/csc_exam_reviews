The following program compiles.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Will the program crash at run time? If so, on which line will it crash?

\begin{lstlisting}
#include <stdlib.h>
int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
	int *x = NULL;
	int *y = NULL;
	int *z = NULL;

	x = (int *) malloc(sizeof(int) * 10);
	y = (int *) malloc(20);
	x = (int *) malloc(sizeof(char) * 50);

	free(x);
	free(y);
	free(z);

	return 0;
}
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{answer}
No, it runs and terminates normally.
\texttt{free} will not do anything if the pointer passed to it is \texttt{NULL}.
\end{answer}

\item What tool can you use to find memory leaks? What options would you use?

\begin{answer}
\texttt{valgrind --leak-check=full <program name>}
\end{answer}

\item What output would you get from part b?  Is there a memory leak? (If so, where?)

\begin{answer}
Something similar to "40 bytes lost". Yes, the first call to \texttt{malloc} is never freed.
\end{answer}
\end{enumerate}
