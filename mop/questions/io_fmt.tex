There is a problem with the following code as written that will manifest itself for certain user input. Explain what this issue is and how to solve it.

\begin{verbatim}
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
        const int BUF_SIZE = 256;
        char buf[BUF_SIZE];
        while (fgets(buf, BUF_SIZE, stdin)) {
                printf(buf);
        }
}
\end{verbatim}

\begin{answer}
If the user enters a string with a \texttt{\%} character, \texttt{printf} will try to interpret this string as a format string, which will not work as intended and will cause undefined behavior, as there are no other arguments to \texttt{printf} for it to format. To solve this issue, replace \texttt{printf(buf);} with \texttt{printf("\%s", buf);}.
\end{answer}
