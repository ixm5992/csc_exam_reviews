\textbf{Initialization and Coercion}

\begin{verbatim}
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    int numbers[] = { 3, 6, 4, 5, 14, 9 };
    int sum, i = 0;
    double average;
    for (; i < 6; ++i) {
        sum += numbers[i];
    }
    average = sum / 6;
    printf("%f", average);
    return 0;
}
\end{verbatim}

There are two issues in the code above. What are they?

\begin{answer}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \texttt{sum} is not initialized to 0, so \texttt{sum} does not contain the actual sum of the numbers in the array.
\item Because \texttt{sum} and \texttt{6} are both of type \texttt{int}, integer division is performed, and \texttt{average} does not contain the expected average, but the floor of the average. Change that line of code to one of the following:
\begin{verbatim}
average = sum / 6.0;
\end{verbatim}
\begin{verbatim}
average = (double)sum / 6;
\end{verbatim}
\begin{verbatim}
average = sum / (double)6;
\end{verbatim}
\end{enumerate}
\end{answer}
