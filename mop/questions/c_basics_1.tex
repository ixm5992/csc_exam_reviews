There are at least two issues in the following code. What are they?

\begin{verbatim}
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    int numbers[] = { 3, 6, 4, 5, 14, 9 };
    int sum, i = 0;
    double average;
    for (; i < 6; ++i) {
        sum += numbers[i];
    }
    average = sum / 6;
    printf("%f", average);
    return 0;
}
\end{verbatim}

\begin{answer}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \texttt{sum} is not initialized, so its value is unspecified at the beginning of the loop. If it doesn't happen to start at 0, the total will be incorrect at the end of the program.
\item Because \texttt{sum} and \texttt{6} are both of type \texttt{int}, integer division is performed, and \texttt{average} does not contain the expected average, but the floor of the average. Change that line of code to one of the following:
\begin{verbatim}
average = sum / 6.0;
\end{verbatim}
\begin{verbatim}
average = (double)sum / 6;
\end{verbatim}
\begin{verbatim}
average = sum / (double)6;
\end{verbatim}
\end{enumerate}
\end{answer}
