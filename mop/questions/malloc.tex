Consider the following statement in a larger program:

\begin{lstlisting}
int* x = (int*) malloc(20); //create an array of 20 ints
\end{lstlisting}

After testing the program, you determine that the value of x[5], x[6], ... , x[19] keeps changing unexpectedly.
\begin{enumerate}
\item
Why is this?

\item
What should the statement actually be?

\end{enumerate}

\begin{answer}
Since ints are usually 4 bytes long, the malloc statement only creates an array of 5 ints (20/4 = 5).
The argument to malloc is how many bytes to allocate, not how many of each element there should be.
A proper (and portable) statement should be \texttt{int* x = (int*) malloc(sizeof(int)*20);}
\end{answer}
