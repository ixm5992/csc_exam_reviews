If you want to store the string \texttt{``Hello, world!''} in the \texttt{str} variable in the following code, at least what value should \texttt{n} have? Why?
\begin{lstlisting}
int n;
...
char str[n];
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{answer}
It should at least have the value 14.

\end{answer}

\item What is the character literal for the null terminator?
