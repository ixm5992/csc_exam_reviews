What is a \emph{primitive data type}? Provide 3 examples of primitive data types in C.

\begin{answer}
Primitive data types are supported by the language itself,
as opposed to ones that are built from a combination of other objects (\emph{structured}),
and ones that are extensions to the language (\emph{user-defined}).
Examples of primitive data types include: \texttt{int}, \texttt{float}, \texttt{char}, \texttt{double}, \texttt{void}.
