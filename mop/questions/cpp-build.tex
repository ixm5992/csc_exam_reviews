Consider the following program:

\lstinputlisting[basicstyle=\scriptsize]{code/cpp_build.c}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item What flag would you use to enable the Windows specific build?

	\begin{answer}
		\texttt{-DWINDOWS}
		This causes \texttt{WINDOWS} to be \texttt{\#define}d at compile time.
	\end{answer}

	\item Why is this useful?

	\begin{answer}
		You can use the same source for building on multiple platforms.
	\end{answer}

	\item Why is the macro useful?

	\begin{answer}
		It condenses a long function call into a simple call with standard arguments.
	\end{answer}
\end{enumerate}
