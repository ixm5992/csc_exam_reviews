\begin{enumerate}

\item List a difference between imperative/procedural programming and object-oriented programming.

\begin{answer}
In procedural programming, the program is a flat collection of global functions and variables. In object-oriented programming, functions and variables are grouped together into class types, which integrate both data and behavior, and can be encapsulated from other classes.
\end{answer}


\item List a difference that functional programming has from procedural or object-oriented programming.

\begin{answer}
In functional programming, functions return values based solely on their input, and do not affect the state of any other data. Rather than programs being composed of statements executed in sequence, programs are composed of function applications which produce the desired output.
