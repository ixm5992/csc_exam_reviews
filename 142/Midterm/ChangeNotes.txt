CS2 differences:
Has currently that is not covered under semesters:
	-Question 2: B+ trees
		-It's possible the question could fall under
		week 9: JCF however (however we have a JCF question
		in question 8)

	-Question 4:
		-Covered in Midterm


Needs to Include
	-SOAP: Week 14
		-Don't add (they never did a lab on it, too much effort to learn)
	-GUIs/actionlistener question


Reccomended to add/fix:

	-Question 8b is somewhat obscure without a ref sheet
	-"Name that design pattern" question
		-Subquestion of Design Patterns question (number 6)
	-Reluctant to include question 9, rather lengthy	
		-Change the abductees in question 9 to the current CS2 professors
	

Remove:
	-Question 9 (too lengthy)
	-Question 4 (covered in midterm)
