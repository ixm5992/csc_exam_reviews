\begin{enumerate}


\item Suppose we are talking about the depth-first search (DFS) algorithm.  Nodes are added to the data structures in alphabetical order.
\begin{enumerate}
\item What underlying data structure does this algorithm use?

\begin{answer}
A stack.
\end{answer}

\item
Given the following graph, state the DFS traversal order and show the data structure at each step.
Node \texttt{A} is the start node, and \texttt{F} is the destination node.

\begin{minipage}{0.35\textwidth}
\vspace{-136pt}
\begin{answer}
$\leftarrow$ top of stack \\
A \\
C B \\
E D B \\
D B \\
F B \\
B \\

The traversal order is ACEDF.
\end{answer}
\end{minipage}
\begin{tikzpicture}[shorten >=1pt,auto,node distance=2.8cm,semithick]
	\node[initial,state] (A) {A};
	\node[state]        (B) [above right of=A] {B};
	\node[state]        (C) [below right of=A] {C};
	\node[state]        (D) [right of=B] {D};
	\node[state]        (E) [right of=C] {E};
	\node[state]        (F) [below right of=D] {F};

	\path[->]   (A) edge node {} (C)
		(A) edge node {} (B)
		(B) edge node {} (C)
		(B) edge node {} (D)
		(C) edge node {} (D)
		(C) edge node {} (E)
		(D) edge node {} (F);
\end{tikzpicture}

\item
What path from \texttt{A} to \texttt{F} does the DFS algorithm return?

\begin{answer}
ACDF 
\end{answer}

\end{enumerate}


\item Now consider a BFS algorithm, again populating data structures in alphabetical order.
\begin{enumerate}
\item
What changes would need to be made to a DFS implementation to turn it into a breadth-first search (BFS)?

\begin{answer}
Use a queue data structure (instead of a stack).
\end{answer}

\item
Using the graph as described in Question 1, what is the BFS traversal order?
Show the data structure at each step. \\
\begin{answer}
$\leftarrow$ front of queue \\
A \\
B C \\
C D \\
D E \\
E F \\
F \\

The traversal order is ABCDEF.
\end{answer}

\item
What path from \texttt{A} to \texttt{F} results from the BFS algorithm?

\begin{answer}
ABDF
\end{answer}

\end{enumerate}


\item When is a vertex's sum weight finalized in Dijkstra's algorithm?

    \begin{answer}
    A vertex's sum weight is final after it has updated the tentative distances
    of all of its neighbors. As part of being finalized, it's moved from the
    unvisited set to the visited set.
    \end{answer}


\item What role does the priority queue play in finding the shortest path?
      When do we use it?

    \begin{answer}
    The priority queue is used to select the next vertex to visit. We want to
    visit the node which currently has the lowest tentative distance from the
    start, so we use a priority queue that always returns the lowest element.
    \end{answer}


\item Why does Dijkstra's algorithm not work correctly on graphs with negative
      edge weights?

\begin{answer}
Dijkstra's algorithm doesn't work correctly on graphs with negative edge
weights due to one of its {\em greedy} behaviors.

When selecting the next node to visit, Dijkstra's algorithm chooses the
node with the current lowest total value, then {\em finalizes} that value
forever. If there were another route to that node, which had not yet been
explored (and contained a net negative weight) Dijkstra's algorithm would
return a suboptimal path.
\end{answer}


\vspace{24pt}
\item
Consider the following graph. \\
\includegraphics[height=150px]{graph}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
Perform Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between C and E. \\
\def\arraystretch{1.65}
\begin{tabu}{| c | c | c | c | c | c | c |}
\hline
Finalized & A & B & C & D & E & F\\
\hline
-- & ($\infty$, None) & ($\infty$, None) & \textbf{(0, None)} & ($\infty$, None) & ($\infty$, None) & ($\infty$, None) \\
\answerrow{C & \textbf{(4, C)} & ($\infty$, None) & (0, None) & ($\infty$, None) & ($\infty$, None) & \textbf{(6, C)}} \\
\answerrow{A & (4, C) & \textbf{(6, A)} & (0, None) & \textbf{(11, A)} & ($\infty$, None) & (6, C)} \\
\answerrow{F & (4, C) & (6, A) & (0, None) & \textbf{(7, F)} & \textbf{(12, F)} & (6, C)} \\
\answerrow{B & (4, C) & (6, A) & (0, None) & (7, F) & \textbf{(11, B)} & (6, C)} \\
\answerrow{D & (4, C) & (6, A) & (0, None) & (7, F) & (11, B) & (6, C)} \\
\answerrow{E & (4, C) & (6, A) & (0, None) & (7, F) & (11, B) & (6, C)} \\
\hline
\end{tabu} \\

\begin{answer}
The shortest path is CABE with a total cost of 11.
To reconstruct this solution, we start with the destination node, then move on to its recorded optimal predecessor.
We repeat the process until we reach the starting node.
(Note that this isn't the only possible table.)
\end{answer}

\item
Did you need to use every row of the above table? Why or why not?

\begin{answer}
No. The algorithm could yield its result as soon as the destination node has been finalized, because it will never change its response after this point.
\end{answer}
\end{enumerate}


\newpage
\item What is the Java Collections Framework? \\
\begin{answer}
    a unified set of interfaces, algorithms and concrete implementations
provided by Java to support collections of objects.
\end{answer}


\vspace{24pt}
\item What are the primary differences between an \texttt{ArrayList} and a \texttt{LinkedList}?

\begin{answer}
\texttt{LinkedList} is implemented as a doubly-linked list.
\\\texttt{ArrayList} is implemented as a dynamically resizing array.
\\ \\\texttt{ArrayList} allows fast random access, but adding or removing from the middle of the array
requires shifting all the elements. \texttt{LinkedList} always has constant-time insertions or removals
if accessed through an iterator (thus we already know the insertion/removal point), but getting
an element requires traversing the list until we get to the wanted index.
\end{answer}
	
\vspace{24pt}
\item In each of the following situations, would it be better to use array-backed storage or a singly linked list?
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Inserting a random number into a sorted list.
	\begin{answer}
	Linked list --- Constant insertion time, whereas an array would necessitate moving all elements after the insertion point.
	\end{answer}
	
	\item Creating a list that will hold all the players in a game.  The game has a max limit on the number of players.
	\begin{answer}
	Array abstraction --- You have a fixed limit, so pre-allocate enough space for them all.
	\end{answer}

	\item Deleting the last element from the list.
	\begin{answer}
	Array abstraction --- Your linked list would have to iterate all the way down, whereas the array structure can simply change its apparent size.
	\end{answer}
			
	\item Deleting from the head end of the list.
	\begin{answer}
	Linked list --- Constant time operation, versus O($n$) for the array-backed container.
	\end{answer}
\end{enumerate}  


\vspace{24pt}
\item Write code to naturally sort the given list in as few lines as possible. You should not need to write a loop or use any numbers (\texttt{Integer}, \texttt{int}, \texttt{Double}, \texttt{double},
\texttt{BigInteger}, etc...).
\begin{verbatim}
List<String> list = Arrays.asList("a", "o", "d", f", "x");
\end{verbatim}
\begin{answer}
\begin{verbatim}
Collections.sort(list);
//or
TreeSet<String> sorted = new TreeSet<String>(list);
\end{verbatim}
\end{answer}


\item Describe the difference between \texttt{Comparable} and \texttt{Comparator}. \\
\begin{answer}
Both are interfaces.
\texttt{Comparable} specifies a method called \texttt{compareTo()} that takes one argument: the object to compare with the one on which the method was called.
\texttt{Comparator} specifies a method called \texttt{compareTo()} that instead takes two arguments and compares those objects to each other.

Making an existing class implement the \texttt{Comparable} interface establishes a canonical ordering for instances of that type.
In contrast, one usually starts a new, empty class when inheriting from \texttt{Comparator}; implementing several such functors for a particular class allows you to sort objects of that type based on different criteria.
\end{answer}


\newpage
\item Briefly explain what an \texttt{Iterator} is, and why you would want
to make something \texttt{Iterable}. How do you specialize an iterator to return objects of the specific type desired? \\ \\
\begin{answer}
An iterator lets us iterate or loop over a collection by visiting every one of its elements or members in succession.
Iterators support checking if a next object exists using \texttt{hasNext()}, returning the next element in the iteration via \texttt{next()}, and removing the last object that was returned using \texttt{remove()}.

\texttt{Iterator} is a generic interface, so you must specify a generic type parameter when you implement it.
For example, a list consisting of \texttt{Person} objects should be traversed with an \texttt{Iterator<Person>}, an iterator that deals in \texttt{Person}s.
\end{answer}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item To make your collection class iterable, you would (circle one):\\
	\textbf{implement the \texttt{Iterable} interface} OR \textbf{implement the \texttt{Iterator} interface}\\
	\begin{answer}
		\textbf{implement the \texttt{Iteratable} interface} (the first one)
	\end{answer}
	\item To make an iterator for your iterable collection class, you would (circle one):\\
	\textbf{implement the \texttt{Iteratable} interface} OR \textbf{implement the \texttt{Iterator} interface}\\
	\begin{answer}
	\textbf{implement the \texttt{Iterator} interface} (the second one)
	\end{answer}
\end{enumerate}


\vspace{24pt}
\item Reimplement the following function using an \texttt{Iterator} instead of a \texttt{for}-each loop.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=java]
public static Integer sum ( ArrayList<Integer> lst ) {
	Integer total = 0 ;
	for( Integer elem : lst ) {
		total = total + elem ;
	}
	return total ;
}
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{answer}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=java]
public static Integer sum (ArrayList<Integer> lst){
	Integer total=0;
	for(Iterator<Integer> iter=lst.iterator();iter.hasNext();){
		Integer cur_val=iter.next(); 
		total=total+cur_val;
	}
	return total;
}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{answer}


\vspace{24pt}
\item Explain the Model-View-Controller design pattern. \\
\begin{answer}
MVC is a way of dividing responsibility within a project's code to prevent it from growing intertwined to the point of unmaintainability.
The model is the portion of the code that manages storing, representing, and manipulating the data.
The controller is the module that accepts user input and prepares it for use by the model.
The view describes the appearance of the user interface.
\end{answer}


\newpage
\item Describe each of the following layout managers:
\begin{enumerate}

\item \texttt{FlowLayout}
\begin{answer}
The \texttt{FlowLayout} class puts components in a row, sized at their preferred size. If the horizontal space in the container is too small to put all the components in one row, the \texttt{FlowLayout} class uses multiple rows. If the container is wider than necessary for a row of components, the row is, by default, centered horizontally within the container. \end{answer}

\item \texttt{BorderLayout}
\begin{answer}
With a \texttt{BorderLayout}, if the window is enlarged, the center area gets as much of the available space as possible. The other areas expand only as much as necessary to fill all available space. Often a container uses only one or two of the areas of the \texttt{BorderLayout} object: for instance, it might place widgets in only the center and the bottom. \end{answer}

\item \texttt{GridLayout}
\begin{answer}
A \texttt{GridLayout} object places components in a grid of cells. Each component takes all the available space within its cell, and all cells are exactly the same size. If the containing window is resized, the \texttt{GridLayout} object changes the cell size so that the cells are as large as possible, given the space available to the container.\end{answer}
\end{enumerate}


\vspace{24pt}
\item Given the following code snippet, rewrite \texttt{ControlListener} as an anonymous class passed into the \texttt{addActionListener()} method calls.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=java]
class ControlListener implements ActionListener{
	public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
		if((JButton)e.getSource()).getText().equals("ok")) {
			System.exit(0);
		} else {
			log.debug("User pressed cancel.");
		}
	}
}

ControlListener cListener = new ControlListener();
JButton okButton = new JButton("ok");
JButton cancelButton = new JButton("cancel");
okButton.addActionListener(cListener);
cancelButton.addActionListener(cListener);
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{answer}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=java]
JButton okButton = new JButton("ok");
okButton.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {
	public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
		System.exit(0);
	}
});

JButton cancelButton = new JButton("cancel");
cancelButton.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {
	public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
		log.debug("User pressed cancel.");
	}
});
\end{lstlisting}
\end{answer}


\newpage
\item Create a class that constructs and displays the following GUI: \\
%image is right-aligned to give students more writing space
\begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth}
\vspace{-48pt}
The buttons within the GUI do not need to be functional.  You may or may not need the following: \texttt{JTextField}, \texttt{JButton}, \texttt{BorderLayout}, \texttt{BoxLayout}, \texttt{FlowLayout.LEFT}, \texttt{JFrame}, \texttt{JComponent}, \texttt{JDesktopPane}, and an exit-on-close operation.  The window should be 300 by 300 pixels and have a title.
\end{minipage}
\hspace{50px}
\begin{minipage}{0.3\textwidth}
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{calculator.png}
\end{minipage} \hfill

\vspace{-48pt}
\begin{answer}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=java,basicstyle=\small]
import java.awt.*;
import javax.swing.*;

public class BasicGUI {

	public BasicGUI() {
		JFrame frame = new JFrame("Kid's Calculator");
		frame.setLayout(new BorderLayout());
		
		JPanel top = new JPanel();
		top.setLayout(new BoxLayout(top, BoxLayout.LINE_AXIS));
		top.add(new JTextField());
		
		JPanel center = new JPanel();
		center.setLayout(new GridLayout(4,3));
		for(int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
			center.add(new JButton(Integer.toString(i)));
		}
		center.add(new JButton("-"));
		center.add(new JButton("+"));
		
		JPanel bottom = new JPanel();
		bottom.setLayout(new FlowLayout(FlowLayout.RIGHT));
		bottom.add(new JButton("Calculate"));
		JButton clearButton = new JButton("Clear");
		bottom.add(clearButton);
		
		Container pane = frame.getContentPane();
		pane.add(top, BorderLayout.NORTH);
		pane.add(center, BorderLayout.CENTER);
		pane.add(bottom, BorderLayout.SOUTH);
		
		frame.pack();
		frame.setSize(300, 300);
		frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
		frame.setVisible(true);
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		BasicGUI gui = new BasicGUI();
	}
}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{answer}


\newpage
\item Briefly explain the differences between the three kinds of exceptions: checked exceptions, runtime exceptions, and errors.
\begin{answer}

\textbf{checked exceptions} -– Exceptions that a method signature must specify it throws. If a method
may throw a checked exception, all calls to that method must be within a \texttt{try}-\texttt{catch} block. Checked exceptions should be used exclusively for foreseeable runtime mistakes, and any reasonably robust
system should be able to recover from one. Classic example is \texttt{IOException}.\\

\textbf{runtime exception} -– Not declared in a method signature and not anticipated to be thrown.
Usually arise due to software bugs and often cause the program to crash. Classic
examples are \texttt{NullPointerException} and \texttt{ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException}.\\

\textbf{errors} -– Represent a serious issue outside of the control of the programmer (hard drive
failure, not enough memory, device issue). Examples are \texttt{IOError}, \texttt{VirtualMachineError} and
\texttt{ThreadDeath} (see Java's \texttt{Error} class).
\end{answer}


\vspace{48pt}
\item Is there anything wrong with the following exception handler as written? Will this
code work as intended? 
\begin{lstlisting}[language=java]
try {
	this.epicFail();
} catch (Exception e) {
	...
} catch (ArithmeticException a) {
	...
}
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{answer}
\texttt{Exception} is more broad than \texttt{ArithmeticException}, so the second \texttt{catch} statement is unreachable.  \texttt{catch} statements should filter possible \texttt{Exception} types from specific to broad.
\end{answer}
