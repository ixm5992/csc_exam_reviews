Briefly explain what an \texttt{Iterator} is, and why you would want
to make something \texttt{Iterable}. How do you specialize an iterator to return objects of the specific type desired? \\ \\
\begin{answer}
An iterator lets us iterate or loop over a collection by visiting every one of its elements or members in succession.
Iterators support checking if a next object exists using \texttt{hasNext()}, returning the next element in the iteration via \texttt{next()}, and removing the last object that was returned using \texttt{remove()}.

\texttt{Iterator} is a generic interface, so you must specify a generic type parameter when you implement it.
For example, a list consisting of \texttt{Person} objects should be traversed with an \texttt{Iterator<Person>}, an iterator that deals in \texttt{Person}s.
