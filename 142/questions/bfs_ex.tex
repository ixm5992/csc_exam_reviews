Now consider a BFS algorithm, again populating data structures in alphabetical order.
\begin{enumerate}
\item
What changes would need to be made to a DFS implementation to turn it into a breadth-first search (BFS)?

\begin{answer}
Use a queue data structure (instead of a stack).
\end{answer}

\item
Using the graph as described in Question 1, what is the BFS traversal order?
Show the data structure at each step. \\
\begin{answer}
$\leftarrow$ front of queue \\
A \\
B C \\
C D \\
D E \\
E F \\
F \\

The traversal order is ABCDEF.
\end{answer}

\item
What path from \texttt{A} to \texttt{F} results from the BFS algorithm?

\begin{answer}
ABDF
\end{answer}

\end{enumerate}
