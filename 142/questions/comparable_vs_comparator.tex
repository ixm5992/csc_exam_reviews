Describe the difference between \texttt{Comparable} and \texttt{Comparator}. \\
\begin{answer}
Both are interfaces.
\texttt{Comparable} specifies a method called \texttt{compareTo()} that takes one argument: the object to compare with the one on which the method was called.
\texttt{Comparator} specifies a method called \texttt{compareTo()} that instead takes two arguments and compares those objects to each other.

Classes implementing \texttt{Comparator} are classes whose sole purpose is to define a comparing mechanism for a particular type. There can be multiple \texttt{Comparator}s for a type, if that type has multiple ways to be compared. If there is a single natural way to compare instances of a particular class, that class can implement the \texttt{Comparable} interface and define the comparison itself. This removes the need to store and pass the comparison mechanism separate from the objects it is comparing.
