Suppose you have the classes DecodeStream and EncodeStream which decodes and encodes text in a particular format.
Assume that both classes buffer I/O and have readLine() which returns a string and writeLine( String s ) respectively to read and write a line at a time.

Write code to read the file "secret.txt", decode it using the DecodeStream, and print the contents.
\begin{answer}
	\begin{lstlisting}[language=java]
		String line;
		DecodeStream in = new DecodeStream( new FileReader( "secret.txt" ) );
		while( ( line = in.readLine() ) != null ) {
			System.out.println( line );
		}
	\end{lstlisting}
\end{answer}
Write code to encode and write a string called "message" to a file.
\begin{answer}
	\begin{lstlisting}[language=java]
		EncodeStream out = new EncodeStream( new FileWriter( "message.txt" ) );
		out.writeLine( message );
		}
	\end{lstlisting}
\end{answer}
