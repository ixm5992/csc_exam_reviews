Suppose you have an encoded file called secret.txt that must be decoded using a stream called DecodeStream.  
Write code to read the file, decode it using the DecodeStream, and print the contents.  
Assume the containing method throws all IOExceptions and DecodeStream is implemented to correctly handle buffered input.

\begin{answer}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=java]
String line;
DecodeStream in = new DecodeStream( new BufferedReader( 
new FileReader( "secret.txt" ) ) );
while( ( line = in.readLine() ) != null ) {
	System.out.println( line );
}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{answer}
