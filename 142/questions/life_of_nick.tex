Nick, an aspiring entrepreneur, trained for 7 grueling years in the jungles of Zimbabwe.
    Nick's preparation was overseen by a group of trainers. His stages of learning were
    fueled by the following process:
    \begin{lstlisting}[numbers=none]
    public class Nick {
        private int experience = 0 ;
        public void train ( ) {
            this.experience += 1 ;
        }
    }\end{lstlisting}Imagine instructors are threads in Java. What are some problems
    we may encounter if Nick is having multiple people train him at the same time?
    How might we remedy these issues?

    \begin{answer}
    The train function, and specifically its incrementation, is non-atomic, meaning the value of Nick's 
    \texttt{experience} variable will be undefined after multiple threads attempt to call the function concurrently.  One solution would be to synchronize on \texttt{Nick} to ensure only one thread at a time executes within the critical section.\\
