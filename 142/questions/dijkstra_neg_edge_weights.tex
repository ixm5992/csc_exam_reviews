Why does Dijkstra's algorithm not work correctly on graphs with negative
      edge weights?

\begin{answer}
Dijkstra's algorithm doesn't work correctly on graphs with negative edge
weights due to one of its {\em greedy} behaviors.

When selecting the next node to visit, Dijkstra's algorithm chooses the
node with the current lowest total value, then {\em finalizes} that value
forever. If there were another route to that node, which had not yet been
explored (and contained a net negative weight) Dijkstra's algorithm would
return a suboptimal path.
