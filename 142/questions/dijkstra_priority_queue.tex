In Dijkstra's algorithm, what role does the priority queue play in finding the shortest path?
When do we use it?

    \begin{answer}
    The priority queue is used to select the next vertex to visit. We want to
    visit the node which currently has the lowest tentative distance from the
    start, so we use a priority queue that always returns the lowest element.
