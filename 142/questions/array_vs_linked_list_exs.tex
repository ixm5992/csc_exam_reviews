In each of the following situations, would it be better to use array-backed storage or a singly linked list?
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Inserting a random number into a sorted list.
	\begin{answer}
	Linked list --- Constant insertion time, whereas an array would necessitate moving all elements after the insertion point.
	\end{answer}
	
	\item Creating a list that will hold all the players in a game.  The game has a max limit on the number of players.
	\begin{answer}
	Array abstraction --- You have a fixed limit, so pre-allocate enough space for them all.
	\end{answer}

	\item Deleting the last element from the list.
	\begin{answer}
	Array abstraction --- Your linked list would have to iterate all the way down, whereas the array structure can simply change its apparent size.
	\end{answer}
			
	\item Deleting from the head end of the list.
	\begin{answer}
	Linked list --- Constant time operation, versus O($n$) for the array-backed container.
	\end{answer}
\end{enumerate}
