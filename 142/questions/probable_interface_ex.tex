\begin{enumerate}
\item Why should \texttt{Probable} be an interface, rather than a class or an abstract class?

\begin{answer}
\texttt{Probable} needs to define that certain actions can be performed on \texttt{Probable} objects, but does not need to define what those actions should do.
\end{answer}

\end{answer}

\item Should the \texttt{Redneck} and \texttt{Professor} classes implement \texttt{Probable} directly?

\begin{answer}
No! Since \texttt{Redneck} and \texttt{Professor} objects are stored in variables of type \texttt{Human}, they must extend the \texttt{Human} class. \texttt{Human} must be a class rather than an interface because it has state information that must be inherited.
In addition, since the \texttt{Human} variables are able to be added into a collection of \texttt{Probable} objects, the \texttt{Human} class must implement \texttt{Probable}, which will carry down into the \texttt{Redneck} and \texttt{Professor} classes.
\end{answer}

\end{enumerate}
