Briely name and describe how the following Java features implement their respective design patterns.  Iterator, Observer/Observable, and Streams.

\begin{answer}
The Iterator interface implements the iterator pattern. It allows access to a list data structure, put protects it by keeping the implementation hidden and only providing the functions needed.
The Observer/Observable interfaces implement the Observer pattern.  They allow for an observable class to notify its observers of changes, which they can then retreive by accessor methods.
Streams implement the decorator pattern.  The stream classes allow for a programmer to define read and write methods of their own, which can then be used on any other stream, allowing for "decoration" of any of the basic streams without knowing their implementation.
\end{answer}
