What are the primary differences between an \texttt{ArrayList} and a \texttt{LinkedList}?

\begin{answer}
\texttt{LinkedList} is implemented as a doubly-linked list.
\\\texttt{ArrayList} is implemented as a dynamically resizing array.
\\ \\\texttt{ArrayList} allows fast random access, but adding or removing from the middle of the array
requires shifting all the elements. \texttt{LinkedList} always has constant-time insertions or removals
if accessed through an iterator (thus we already know the insertion/removal point), but getting
an element requires traversing the list until we get to the wanted index.
\end{answer}
