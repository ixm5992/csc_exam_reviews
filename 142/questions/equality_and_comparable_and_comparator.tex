Briefly describe the difference (for objects) between \texttt{a.equals(b)}, \texttt{a==b},
      \texttt{a.compareTo(b)}, and \texttt{Comparator.compare(a,b)}.

    \begin{answer}
    \begin{itemize}

    \item \texttt{a.equals(b)} Compares objects for equality. Class \texttt{Object} provides a default implementation
	that is overridden for more intelligent behavior.
    Returns a \texttt{boolean}.

    \item \texttt{a == b}  Checks references (if the two objects are the SAME object).
    Can also be used to check whether \texttt{a} is \texttt{null}.

    \item \texttt{a.compareTo(b)} Returns an \texttt{int} indicating whether \texttt{a} is less than (-1),
    equal to (0), or greater than (+1) \texttt{b}, according to their natural ordering.
	Specified by the \texttt{Comparable} interface.

    \item \texttt{compare(a,b)} Returns a negative a $<$ b, 0 if a $=$ b, a positive if a $>$ b. \\
    \texttt{comp1.equals(comp2)} implies that \\ \texttt{sgn(comp1.compare(o1,
    o2))==sgn(comp2.compare(o1, o2))} for every object reference \texttt{o1} and \texttt{o2}.

    \end{itemize}
