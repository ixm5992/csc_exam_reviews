What is the difference between an abstract class and an interface? Why might you want to use an interface over an abstract class? \\
\begin{answer}
Abstract classes can have fields, whereas interfaces cannot. Classes can implement multiple interfaces, but can only extend a single class. Because of this, if you want an class to be able to be treated as two or more unrelated types, make those types interfaces. In Java 7 and earlier, interfaces can only have method signatures, without any implementation. Abstract classes can have a mix of abstract methods and methods with an implementation. This allows abstract classes to provide default behavior for their subclasses, as well as common base behavior that subclasses can extend from.
