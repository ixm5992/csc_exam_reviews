What is the difference between an abstract class and an interface? Why might you want to use an interface over an abstract class? \\
\begin{answer}
Abstract classes allow for default method behavior to be defined, while interfaces allow only method declaration.  Since Java allows a class to extend only a single class but implement many interfaces, interfaces provide some extended capabilities. However, extending an abstract class allows usage of the defined default behaviors.
