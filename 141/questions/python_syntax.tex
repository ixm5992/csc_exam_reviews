Although most people in the CS field will be somewhat forgiving when it comes to coding by hand,
you should still be reasonably familiar with the syntax of your language of choice.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Identify and fix the line(s) that have invalid syntax in the following code:\\
\emph{If you are unsure about a specific line, just write a brief explanation of the error. Assume that incorrect lines do not affect the validity of other lines which may depend on them.}
\begin{lstlisting}
include math

int a = 0
b = 0;
c = (int)(0)

for x in range(0, 100):
	print x

def function(int arg):
	return (arg + 2)

sum = b + math.sqrt(c)
total = a + (b ** 0.5)

myList = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for element in myList:
	print(element)

for p in range(0, myList.len()-1):
	print(myList[p])
\end{lstlisting}

	\item[1] This line should read "\texttt{import math}", or, alternatively, "\texttt{from math import *}".
	\item[3] Python is a dynamically-typed language, so you cannot specify a variable's type in this manner.
	\item[8] In Python 3, '\texttt{print}' is a function (rather than a statement), so you need to use parenthesis around the text to print.
	\item[10] Like line 3, you cannot specify the type of a formal parameter in a dynamically-typed language.
	\item[20] You want to use the built-in Python statement \texttt{len()} like this:\\
	 "\texttt{for p in range(0, len(myList)-1):}".

\item Which of the following are keywords or standard functions in Python?\\
\texttt{import\hspace{10mm}in\hspace{10mm}from\hspace{10mm}class\hspace{10mm}define\hspace{10mm}int\hspace{10mm}str\hspace{10mm}String}\\
\texttt{True\hspace{9mm}false\hspace{9mm}where\hspace{9mm}while\hspace{9mm}or\hspace{9mm}not\hspace{9mm}isinstance\hspace{9mm}new}\\
\texttt{print\hspace{13mm}range\hspace{13mm}float\hspace{13mm}char\hspace{13mm}bool\hspace{13mm}xor\hspace{13mm}sum}\\

\begin{answer}
All of these are valid, except \texttt{define, String, false, where, new, xor, char}.
\end{answer}
\end{enumerate}
