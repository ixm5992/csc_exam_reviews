Although most in the industry will be reasonably forgiving when it comes to coding by hand,
you should still be comfortable with the syntax of your language of choice.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Identify and fix the line(s) that have invalid syntax in the following code:\\
\emph{If you are unsure about a specific line, just write a brief explanation of the error. Assume that incorrect lines do not affect the validity of other lines which may depend on them.}
\begin{lstlisting}
include math

int a = 0
b = 0

def function(int arg):
	return (arg + 2)

c = "hello"
sum = b + math.sqrt(c)
total = a + (b ** 0.5)
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{answer}
\begin{description}

	\item[1] This line should read "\texttt{import math}", or, alternatively, "\texttt{from math import *}".
	\item[3] Python is a dynamically-typed language, so you cannot specify a variable's type in this manner.
	\item[6] Like line 3, you cannot specify the type of a formal parameter in a dynamically-typed language.
	\item[10] This line will cause a runtime error because \texttt{sqrt} tries to perform mathematical operations on a string, which is invalid.

\end{description}
\end{answer}

\item Which of the following \textit{are} keywords or standard functions in Python?\\
\texttt{import\hspace{10mm}in\hspace{10mm}from\hspace{10mm}class\hspace{10mm}define\hspace{10mm}int\hspace{10mm}str\hspace{10mm}String}\\
\texttt{True\hspace{9mm}false\hspace{9mm}where\hspace{9mm}while\hspace{9mm}or\hspace{9mm}not\hspace{9mm}isinstance\hspace{9mm}new}\\
\texttt{print\hspace{13mm}range\hspace{13mm}float\hspace{13mm}char\hspace{13mm}bool\hspace{13mm}xor\hspace{13mm}sum}\\

\begin{answer}
All of these are valid, except \texttt{define, String, false, where, new, xor, char}.
\end{answer}
\end{enumerate}
