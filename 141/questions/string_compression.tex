Write a function which performs a basic string compression, which uses counts of repeated characters. For example 
the string $abbbccccaaa$ would be compressed to: $a1b3c4a3$. \\
 \emph{Assume a function \texttt{len( str )} which returns the length of a string is provided. \\
      assume a function \texttt{int( str )} which, given a string representation of an integer, returns its integer value. \\
      Assume a function \texttt{str( int )} which, given an integer, returns the string representation of this integer, is provided. }

\begin{answer}
\begin{lstlisting}
def compress( string ):
    new = ''
    curChar = string[0]
    count = 0
    for char in string:
        if char == curChar:
            count += 1
        else:
            new = new + curChar + str(count)
            curChar = char
            count = 1 

    new = new + curChar + str(count)
    return new
\end{lstlisting}
