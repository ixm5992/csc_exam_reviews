Write a function which performs basic string compression, using the counts of repeated characters. For example, 
the string $abbbccccaaa$ would be compressed to: $a1b3c4a3$. \\
 \emph{Assume the function \texttt{len( str )}, which returns the length of a string, is provided. \\
      Further, assume you may use \texttt{int( str )} and \texttt{str( int )}, which converts a string to its integer representation, and converts an integer to its string representation, respectively.}

\begin{answer}
\begin{lstlisting}
def compress( string ):
    new = ''
    curChar = string[0]
    count = 0
    for char in string:
        if char == curChar:
            count += 1
        else:
            new = new + curChar + str(count)
            curChar = char
            count = 1 

    new = new + curChar + str(count)
    return new
\end{lstlisting}
\end{answer}
