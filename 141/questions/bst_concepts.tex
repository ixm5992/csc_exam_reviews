\begin{enumerate}
	\item If we have a \textbf{balanced} binary search tree containing $n$ nodes:
		\begin{enumerate}
		    \item What is its height? \\
			\begin{answer}
				$\log_2(n)$
			\end{answer}
		    \item How much time would it take to traverse to any of the leaf nodes of this tree? \\
			\begin{answer}
				$\log_2(n)$
			\end{answer}
		    \item What's the worst case search time for an unbalanced search tree? \\
			\begin{answer}
				$n$
			\end{answer}
		\end{enumerate}
	\item How many leaves are in a \textbf{complete} BST containing $n$ nodes? \\
		\begin{answer}
			$\floor*{(n+1)/2}$
		\end{answer}
	\item In terms of runtime efficiency, what is the worst possible configuration (e.g. arrangement of nodes and their children) of a binary search tree? Sketch a small example of what such a configuration looks like. \\
		\begin{answer}
			A perfectly \textit{imbalanced} tree, in which all nodes have one or 0 children. \\

				\begin{tikzpicture}
					\node [draw,ellipse] at (5, 0) (head) {1};
					\node [draw,ellipse] at (7, -.5) (2) {2};
					\node [draw,ellipse] at (9, -1) (3) {3};
					\node [draw,ellipse] at (11, -1.5) (4) {4};
					\node [draw,ellipse] at (13, -2) (5) {5};
					
					\path [draw] (head) -- (2);
					\path [draw] (2) -- (3);
					\path [draw] (3) -- (4);
					\path [draw] (4) -- (5);
				\end{tikzpicture}
			
			
		\end{answer}
	\item Based on your answer above, what data structure is such a BST reminiscent of? \\
		\begin{answer}
			A perfectly imbalanced tree as described above operates like a \textbf{linked list}.
		\end{answer}
\end{enumerate}
