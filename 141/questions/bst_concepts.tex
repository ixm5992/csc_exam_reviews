If we have a balanced binary search tree (meaning its height is as small as
    possible) containing $n$ nodes:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item What is its height? \\
                \begin{answer}
                $\log_2(n)$
                \end{answer}
            \item How much time would it take to traverse to any of the leaf
            nodes of this tree. \\
                \begin{answer}
                $\log_2(n)$
                \end{answer}
            \item What's the worst case search time for an unbalanced search
            tree? \\
                \begin{answer}
                $n$
                \end{answer}
        \end{enumerate}
