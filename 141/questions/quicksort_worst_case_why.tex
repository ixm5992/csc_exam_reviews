What causes Quicksort to run so slowly on the input you describe in the last question?

\begin{answer}
Quicksort splits its input into two lists based on the value of the pivot.
If the pivot is either the smallest or the largest element, then one list
will only have no elements, while the others will have all of the elements except the pivot.
