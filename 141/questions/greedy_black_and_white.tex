\textbf{Greedy algorithms.}
In the game Black and White\footnote{Special thanks to Professor Butler for unwittingly allowing us to rip off his problem.}, the player is faced with a row of identical double-sided chips.
You can probably guess what colors the two sides of each chip are.
The objective is to flip as many chips as necessary so their exposed colors match that of a target pattern. \\
The catch?
Reordering the chips is said to be Impossible by those who seem to know what they're talking about. \\
The \textit{real} catch?
Flipping a group of consecutive tiles can be accomplished in a single ``action.'' \\
If every flip takes one ``action,'' write a function \texttt{bwMoves} that, given a starting pattern and target pattern as equal-length strings, returns the minimum number of actions required to get them to match.
For instance, \texttt{bwMoves( 'BBWBBWBBBB', 'WWWWWBBWWB' )} should return 3.

\textit{Hint: Were any of the other questions labeled with the concept they were testing?}
\begin{answer}
\begin{lstlisting}
def bwMoves(start, target):
	actions=0
	first=0
	for index in range(len(start)):
		if start[index]==target[index]:
			if first!=index: # Each flip works up to (but not including)
				actions+=1	 # the index pointer. If first==index, that's
			first=index+1	 # 0 elements, so there is nothing to flip.
							 # (i.e. There were two no-flips in a row.)
	if start[-1]!=target[-1]:
		actions+=1
	return actions
\end{lstlisting}
