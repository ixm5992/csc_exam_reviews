You are given the linked list: $1 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 3$.  You may assume that each node has one field called \texttt{value} and one called \texttt{next}.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item 1 points to 2 and 2 points to 3. What does 3 point to? \\
                \begin{answer}
				The implementer may cause the 3 node to point to either \texttt{None} or a sentinel node.
				\end{answer}
            \item Draw out the linked list structure and add a 5 to the end.

				\leftmargin=0em
				\itemindent=0em
				{ \small
				\begin{verbatim}
+----------+    +----------+    +----------+    +------------+
| value: 1 |    | value: 2 |    | value: 3 |    | value: 5   |
| next: ------->| next: ------->| next: ------->| next: None |
+----------+    +----------+    +----------+    +------------+
				\end{verbatim}
				\textit{OR}
				\begin{verbatim}
+----------+    +----------+    +----------+    +----------+    +-----------------+
| value: 1 |    | value: 2 |    | value: 3 |    | value: 5 |    | value: SENTINEL |
| next: ------->| next: ------->| next: ------->| next: ------->|                 |
+----------+    +----------+    +----------+    +----------+    +-----------------+
				\end{verbatim} }
				\end{answer}
            \item Write pseudocode to add an element onto the end of a linked list.
				\begin{answer}
				\begin{lstlisting}
def append(value, linked_list):
	newend = new node
	newend.value = value
	newend.next = None # (or SENTINEL)
	curend = end node of linked_list
	curend.next = newend
				\end{lstlisting}
				\end{answer}

            \item Looking at the list from (b), you notice that we forgot to
                  add in a 4. What is a procedure for doing this? (There are
                  many possibilities.) \\
                \begin{answer}
				Use some variation of this strategy: Find the preceding element's node (in this case, 3), link its next node to the new node containing 4, then link that new node to what was the following node.
