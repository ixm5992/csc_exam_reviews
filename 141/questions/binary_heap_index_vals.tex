Given a node in an array-based binary heap at index $i$, where are the
      indices of both its children? What is the index of its parent?

    \begin{answer}
    The children are at $2i+1$ and $2i+2$. The parent is at
    $\lfloor\frac{i-1}{2}\rfloor$.

    \marginpar{\small\em Note that in a 1 indexed array system, the children
    would be at $2i$ and $2i+1$. The parent would be at
    $\lfloor\frac{i}{2}\rfloor$.}
    \end{answer}
