For the sake of this question, you find yourself to be the head programmer under Kim Jong Un's glorious reign.
It also just so happens that a nation-wide track meet is being held today. Thus, the glorious leader has demanded that
you write a program to keep track of information relating to all track runners present at the event.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Write a class named \texttt{TrackRunner} to keep track of all runners competing.
You will need to store their \texttt{name}, \texttt{age}, and \texttt{fastestTime}.
\begin{answer}
\begin{lstlisting}
class TrackRunner:
    __slots__=('name','age','fastestTime')

\end{lstlisting}
\end{answer}

\item Now write a function to make an individual TrackRunner object.
\begin{answer}
\begin{lstlisting}
def makeRunner(r_name,r_age,r_fastestTime):
    runner = TrackRunner()
    runner.name = r_name
    runner.age = r_age
    runner.fastestTime = r_fastestTime
    return runner
\end{lstlisting}
\end{answer}

\item The glorious leader has decided that, on this day, no runner named \texttt{Joe} may win
gold. Given a list of \texttt{TrackRunner} objects, write the function \texttt{aWinnerIsYou(r)} that finds the runner in the list \texttt{r} with the fastest time who's name is not Joe. 
Then print the runner's name, age and time.
\begin{lstlisting}

\end{lstlisting}
\begin{answer}
\begin{lstlisting}
def aWinnerIsYou(r):
    best = None
    for i in range(len(r)):
        if r[i].name != 'Joe':
            if best == None:
                best = r[i]
            elif best.fastestTime > r[i].fastestTime:
                best = r[i]
    return best

best = aWinnerIsYou(runnersLst)
print(best.name, best.age, best.fastestTime)
\end{lstlisting}
\end{answer}
\end{enumerate}
