Write a function that takes in a file name, and returns the average
        size of a word in that file. The files will only have 1 word per line,
        for example:

        \begin{center}
        No\\
        soup\\
        for\\
        you!
        \end{center}

        which has an average length of: 3.25 \\ \emph{Assume a function \texttt{len( str )} which returns the length of a string is provided.}


\begin{answer}
\begin{lstlisting}
def average_wordlength(filename):
    characters = 0
    words = 0
    for line in open(filename):
        words += 1
        characters += len(line)
    return characters/words
\end{lstlisting}
\end{answer}
